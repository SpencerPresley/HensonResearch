# Research into idea

## Idea

- Revolving around 1 bit LLMs.
- They help save on compute and memory.
- Because of this it saves on energy and money which is better for the enviroinment and buisnesses.
- This could also allow for more smaller, less funded companies, developing/training their own LLMs {?}
- Can allow for more localized LLM application
  - Siri: Better power offline. Better ability to recognize what a user is intending to have siri do.
  - Smart application like fridges, cars, etc. Adding in localized LLMs to these things could allow for significant experience in user interaction.
- Large and larger LLMs could be built and used to solve more complex problems.
  - Due to memory consumption being less you can train larger models

## How to turn this into research  

- The research must be have the goal of discovering something new
- Repeating what's already done is not useful and not likely to get approved
- While things like smart applications and better virtual assistants (Siri) could be outcomes of 1 bit llm development, that itself cannot be what the research is studying. Though this could be something to go into the personal statement.  

## Ideas of what can be discovered  



## How can I do those things? This section helps with determining what's feasible and what's not.
